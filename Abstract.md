**Effect of Visual Noise on High-Gamma ECoG Response Latency in the Fusiform Gyrus During Face Recognition.**

**Abstract:**  
Face-selective brain regions, such as the fusiform gyrus, support robust face recognition even under degraded visual conditions (Miller et al., 2017). While previous studies have shown that visual noise slows behavioral face recognition (Kwon et al., 2016), it is reasonable to ask whether neural processing in the fusiform gyrus compensates for increased image noise by delaying its high-gamma band response latency. This study investigates whether higher levels of visual noise affect both the timing and the slope of the first peak in high-gamma band power activity during correctly recognized face trials.

Using electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings from two patients performing a face identification task across varying levels of visual noise, we examined the relationship between image degradation and both the latency and slope of the first high-gamma band power peak within the fusiform gyrus. Event-related high-gamma power epochs were extracted and analyzed across different noise categories.
The results show that, for one of the electrodes located in the fusiform gyrus and across both patients, face images with higher noise—while still recognizable—are associated with: 

1.	A reduced slope in the rising edge of the first high-gamma band power peak, indicating a slower rate of power increase as noise levels rise. 
2.	An increased latency of the first high-gamma band power peak.

These findings suggest a compensatory mechanism in the brain that preserves face perception under noisy conditions at the cost of processing speed.
